# ML UNet Variants on BRAT2020 Dataset

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our machine learning project exploring UNet and its variants on the BRAT2020 dataset for the ML course in ITI4

## Overview

UNet is a convolutional network architecture for fast and precise segmentation of images. It has been widely used in biomedical image segmentation tasks. In this project, we experiment with UNet and several of its variants to segment the BRAT2020 dataset, which contains MRI scans of brain tumors.

## Contents

- **src/**: Jupyter notebook used for training and evaluating UNet models.
- **data/**:  the BRAT2020 dataset.

- **README.md**: Project overview and setup instructions.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unet-brat2020.git
cd unet-brat2020
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The BRAT2020 dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2020/data.html). After downloading, place the dataset in the `data/` directory. The data preparation script will handle the rest.
